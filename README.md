## Why MagicWE2?
_Rainbow sprinkles!_

Jokes aside, here is a list of pros:

- Simple usage
- Translations
- Good performance and great speeds
- Progress bars like on Windows 98!
- Sessions
- Clipboards
- Optimized item / block parsing - you can place any block, by id, name, and item!
- Alot more commands
- Command auto-completion
- Command flags (i.e. -p for relative copying/pasting, -h for hollow objects)
- UI for brush setup and configuration
- Fancy icon and optional startup ASCII art
- Direct bug reporting to GitHub
<!-- 
- schematic support
- MyPlot support
-->

## Commands
<!-- TODO change to master branch -->
You can find a list of commands here: [COMMANDS.MD](https://github.com/thebigsmileXD/MagicWE2/blob/palette-preview/COMMANDS.MD)

## Planned features
- Saved sessions (saved brushes and clipboards)
- More commands, a glimpse at the plugin.yml should give you a good look what is coming up
- Command based flags, since they are currently in a global state
- Schematic and structure block data support
- Clipboard naming, exporting and switching
- ScoreboardAPI integration
- Better and more brushes. For now i suggest using [BlockSniper](https://github.com/BlockHorizons/BlockSniper) for brushes!
- [MyPlot](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot) integration
